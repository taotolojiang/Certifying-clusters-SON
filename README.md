# Certifying clusters from sum-of-norms clustering
Sum-of-norms clustering is a clustering formulation based on convex optimization that automatically induces hierarchy. We present a clustering test for sum-of-norms clustering that identifies and certifies the correct cluster assignment from an approximate solution yielded by any primal-dual algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted on Gaussian mixture and half-moon data.  Relying on the fact that our certification extends to multiplicative weighting, our numerical experiments illustrate a technique to strengthen the recovery power of sum-of-norms clustering applied to data sampled from distributions with peaks such as a Gaussian mixture.

This repository contains the numerical implementation for the clustering test in \[1\] and the ADMM algorithm presented in \[2\]. 

### Dependencies
The code has been tested in `Julia 1.3` and depends on the packages `Distributions`, `LinearAlgebra`, `Random`, `Distributions`, `LightGraphs`.

### Short Tour
- `cluster_test.jl` implements ADMM in \[2\] to solve SON with both uniform and multiplicative weights and the clustering test in \[1\] to certify cluster assignments.
